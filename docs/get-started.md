# Get Started

This project discusses how we can find misconfigurations in configuration files. Check out the [content page](content.md) for a detailed overview of this project.

## Try it out yourself

There are interactive and reproducible notebooks for this entire [project](https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/configuration-files-analysis) available for anyone to start using on the public [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub-opf-jupyterhub.apps.zero.massopen.cloud/hub/login) instance on the [Massachusetts Open Cloud](https://massopen.cloud/) (MOC) right now!

1. To get started, access [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub-opf-jupyterhub.apps.zero.massopen.cloud/), select log in with `moc-sso` and sign in using your Google Account.
2. After signing in, on the spawner page, please select the `Configuration File Analysis Notebook Image` in the JupyterHub Notebook Image section from the dropdown and select a `Medium` container size and hit `Start` to start your server.
3. Once your server has spawned, you should see a directory titled `s2i-configuration-files-analysis-<current-timestamp>`.
4. Go to `notebooks` and run the notebook you want to experiment with.
5. Check out the detailed [content](content.md) page with project blog and notebooks.
